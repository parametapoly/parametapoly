<!--
**parametapoly/parametapoly** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning programming fundamentals and building small personal projects.  
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# and game development basics using Unity.  
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on simple game projects or beginner-friendly coding challenges.  
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with game architecture and turning ideas into structured projects.  
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about what I'm learning or how I plan and track my projects!  
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: [seru78533@gmail.com] or via GitHub issues  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love thinking about how games are designed as much as I love playing them!
